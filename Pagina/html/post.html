            These sea creatures create magnificent mucus nets to catch their food</h1>
        <p>Scientists think these critters deserve their own category in recognition of this strange feeding method.</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JLEV70Y.jpg" alt="">
        <p>All animals must eat to survive. If you’ve heard the term “grazer” before, it may bring to mind familiar farm animals,
            such as cows or sheep munching on pastureland. But the ocean has its own suite of grazers, with very different
            — even bizarre — body forms and feeding techniques. Instead of teeth, one group of these invertebrates uses sheets
            of mucus to consume huge quantities of tiny plant-like particles. In our new paper, my colleagues and I suggest
            a new categorization for this overlooked group: “mucous-mesh grazers,” in recognition of their unusual feeding
            strategy. Unlike the mucus in our noses, which appears amorphous and blobby, the mucous sheets of these ocean
            grazers can be structured into ornate meshes and nets. These mucous sheets can function like a filter to ensnare
            food as small as bacteria. The grazers themselves are mammoth in comparison: up to 10,000 times bigger than their
            food. If people ate food that small, you’d be picking salt and sugar grains off your dinner plate. Marine biologists
            like me used to think mucous grazing was a “catch-all” feeding strategy – the idea was these guys would just
            chow down on whatever their mucous sheet caught. But recent technological advances are helping us understand
            that mucous grazers can be picky eaters. And what they consume — or don’t — influences ocean food webs.</p>

        <h2>How does mucous-mesh grazing work?</h2>
        <p>Mucous-mesh grazers include salps, pyrosomes, doliolids, pteropods and appendicularians. They are typically centimeters
            in length, roughly spanning the size of your fingernail to the size of your hand. Some form colonies comprised
            of many individuals in long chains that can be much longer. These creatures are large and watery compared to
            their hard-bodied planktonic counterparts. If you stepped on one, it would squish, not crunch. A mostly water
            body enables them to grow large quickly.</p>
        <p>Mucous-mesh grazers are free floating and suited to the open ocean. They live far from shore, where food is scarce
            and often small. The tiny holes and fibers of their mucous meshes enable them to capture microscopic particles,
            which they subsequently swallow, sometimes along with the mucus.</p>
        <p>Unlike spiders that spin their feeding webs, these grazers have a special organ, called an endostyle, that secretes
            their mucous mesh. Depending on the grazer, the mucous mesh can be located either inside or outside the body.
            One group, for example, secretes a mucous bubble big enough for the animal to live inside like a house. Another
            group, nicknamed sea butterflies, secrete mucous webs that attach to their wing-shaped feet. These mucous webs
            range in size from an inch to over 6 feet.</p>
        <p>Historically, scientists assumed mucous-mesh grazers ate anything that passed through the mucous sieve — similar
            to a strainer in the drain of the kitchen sink catching everything of a certain size that flows in. Recent research
            by my lab and others challenges this assumption and shows that their feeding may be highly selective. The mucus
            might capture certain food particles perfectly, while completely rejecting other particles on the basis of their
            size, shape or surface properties. For example, when presented with a mixture of rod-shaped and spherical food
            particles – differently shaped but otherwise similar in size – one species of mucous-mesh grazer preferentially
            swallows the spherical particles.</p>
